# DOM (DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL)

Browser reads HTML and constructs **Document Object Model (DOM)**,  data representation of objects that comprise structure and content of web doc. Acts as bridge between code and UI, has tree-like structure with parent/child relationships.

Can use DOM methods and programming language, such as JavaScript, to listen to user events and manipulate DOM by selecting, adding, updating, and deleting elements. DOM manipulation also allows changing element style and content. Think of DOM as API for web docs.
