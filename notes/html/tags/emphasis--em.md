# `<em>`

Marks text with stress emphasis. Can be nested, with each level indicating greater degree of emphasis.

```html
<p>This is <em>not</em> a drill!</p>
```

## Usage Notes

Typically displayed in italic type, but should not be used to apply italic styling; use CSS `font-style` instead.

Use `<cite>` to mark title of work (book, play, song, etc.). Use `<i>` to mark text in alternate tone or mood (scientific names, words in other languages, etc.). Use [`<strong>`](./strong.md) to mark text with greater importance than surrounding text.
