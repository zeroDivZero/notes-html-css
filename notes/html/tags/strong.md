# `<strong>`

Indicates contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.

```html
<p>Most important life advice: <strong>Keep calm and carry on!</strong></p>
```

## Usage Notes

Typically rendered as bold type, but to style instead use CSS `font-weight`.

Use `<b>` to draw attention to text without indicating higher level of importance. Use [`<em>`](./emphasis--em.md) to mark text that has stress emphasis.
