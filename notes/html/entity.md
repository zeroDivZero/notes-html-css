# ENTITY

Piece of text (string) that begins with ampersand (`&`) and ends with semicolon (`;`). Frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). Also convenient in place of characters difficult to type with standard keyboard.

## Example

To display heart: `&hearts;` (name), `&#9829;` (decimal), or `&#x2665;` (hex). Search online for codes.
